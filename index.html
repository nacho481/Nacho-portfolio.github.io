          <h2>Software Developer</h2>
          <p>The computer science curriculum can prove to be remiss teaching relevant technologies; however, I decided
            to take into my own hands to audit the best Universities that will provide the best education to transition
            to the work force. I took 18 units in Fall 2021 to force myself to learn web-development and the basics
            of modular Python programming while finishing up to earn 2 certificates in C++ and Java Programming. 
          </p>
          <p>So far, I have only learned became acquianted with the HTML/CSS stack, and I am proficient with data
            structures and algorithms. I aspire to become a more proficient software developer as I continue to
          take classes in community college and upon transferring! </p>

            <h3>YouTube-Playlist-Tracker</h3>
            <p>In MLH's GiveBack Hackathon, I worked on a WPF application, which is a Windows desktop application
              that interacts with YouTube's API to save video title's into a JSON file. One of my peers said that
              he listens to Japanese music and he hasn't the slightest clue on how to spell these song titles; 
              furthermore, how would we remember vidoes that randomly get taken down due to copyright? That's 
              when we knew that this application would come in handy for a commuity of people!

            <h3>Qt GUI Application</h3>
            <p>In my C++ Advanced Object-Oriented Programming class, also known as CIS-17B, 
              we were required to use Qt to create a GUI application exhibiting a facetious
              company. I created a music label that offers an array of purchases that you 
              can make, music services, marketing services and mixing and mastering. Between
              WPF and Qt, these desktop applications introduced how fun it is to use UI!
